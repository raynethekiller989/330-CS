# 330-CS
Throughout the development of my project, I approached software design by first thoroughly analyzing the problem and brainstorming potential solutions, with an emphasis on the userâ€™s experience. I utilized sketches and diagrams to plan system architecture before coding. This project helped me cultivate new design skills, particularly in modular design and user-centered thinking. I adopted an iterative design process that involved planning, prototyping, testing, and refining, which allowed for continuous improvement based on feedback and observations. The tactics I developed, such as modularization and iterative refinement, will be highly applicable to future work by ensuring more efficient and flexible project management. In developing programs, I emphasize understanding project requirements fully, planning system architecture, and building functionality incrementally. While creating my 3D scene, I employed new development strategies including incremental development and frequent testing of individual components before integration. Iteration played a crucial role in this process, as each cycle of testing and refinement enhanced the quality and fidelity of the final product. Over the course of the project milestones, my coding practices evolved from a basic focus on functionality to an emphasis on writing clean, efficient, and reusable code. Computer science has proven instrumental in helping me build problem-solving, critical thinking, and creative skills that will support my broader academic and professional goals. Additionally, my work with computational graphics and visualizations has provided me with new technical and spatial reasoning skills that are valuable for my future educational endeavors in fields such as engineering, data science, and design. Professionally, these experiences will distinguish me by equipping me with the ability to create compelling visuals and simulations, an asset in industries like technology, education, and entertainment.
